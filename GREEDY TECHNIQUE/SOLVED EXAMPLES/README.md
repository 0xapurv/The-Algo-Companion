A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

**Sonuds a bit muddled right ? Don't worry we got you !**

> Let's say that you enter a sports shop where there are four items that you like. The prices of these are also given to you. Assume today is your birthday and your father has given you $250 to spend. Now you like all the items there. So we need to device an algorithm that tells him the maximum number of items that he can buy with the given amount.

> This situation may seem very ordinary, but this indeed explains the core concept of greedy algorithms. What will you do in this situation ? You will start selecting items in the incresing order of their prices till the overall price overshoots the total amount that is given to us. That is exactly how we approach this problem.

**But wait, how will it come under a greedy solution ?**

> To explain this, we need to understand why are we taking the items in the increasing order of their prices. We are doing this because, we think that chooseing the item with lowest price first, will enable us to take more number of items at the end.

> The idea that we take the item that has the least price at that time is nothing but choosing the choice that is optimal locally, and by doing this, we have a solution for the overal problem if we contiue doing this optimal choice until the total amount overshoots the amount that is given to us.

**Here is a vibrant illustration on this context,**
